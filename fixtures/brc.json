We'll also be offering a fire-staff making workshop on Tuesday at\n11 (last year we had too many people show, and ran out of materials, so be relatively\non time), to be followed by an after-dark fire-show at the camp. The show is\nwelcome to all, but new performers will be given preference. We're also going\nto sponsor a real-life &quot;Choose your own Adventure&quot;, that will be a\nmix of activities around the playa, in conjunction with other camps. The day\nand time are TBA, and we'll spread word around early in the week.Hometown: Portland,\nOR \nURL:  \nContact:    \n \n \n \nWe're here once again to see who has the balls to try our concoction and earn\nyourself the prize to take home, for your Moonshine Tavern collection!

Yeah u ucker&quot;.. \nI think God likes to say &quot;ucker&quot;.  \n&quot;I command you to Go to the desert. once there, Build a city. Build a city\nof TITTYS. I command you too. IF THY DOES NOT COVET THY TITTY, they will come\n2\nby 2,&quot; said the voice. \nSince 1999 I have gone to the Black Rock Desert with my dedicated tribe, because\nit takes a few dedicated people to build a City of Tittys. I have collected Titty\nprints using a special painting technique. I start first by preparing my painting\nsurfaces by sanding and sealing 4 foot by eight foot pieces of plywood. I then\npaint the surfaces and frame them. These are my building blocks. I apply paint\nto the tittys and press them onto the boards transferring the prints onto them\neach titty soul then signs the prints, immortalizing them forever. I build my\nbuildings in increments of 8 feet. Each building is 16 feet by 16 feet. Each\npanel locks the other panels into a rigid structure, able to withstand 70 m.p.h.\nwind gusts. And at night they glow under 12, 48 inch double tube black lights.\nIts a process of evolution, it keeps growing and changing.",

Has the dust finally settled, leaving us with an alphabet destined to remain eternally 'as is'? Perhaps a closer look at each letter will let us trace back to the original impulses that began their descent first into images, then later into signs. We also look at how lines in the Chinese ideograms retain elements of the experience of hope and fear. Drawing on the ephemeral material of sand, we invite all signs and symbols of the ancient past and distant future to converge right here, right now in our infinite bodies, the eternal crossroads where hope and fear are forever getting down.",

The arch explodes outward, creating a gallant entrance to Center Camp and in fact creating a whole environment. Every participant on a bicycle becomes part of the sculpture. Building the arch with bikes reclaimed from garbage dumps and recycling centers fits perfectly with the 2007 green theme. Bike Rack was inspired by the artist's trip to Arches National monument. An arch is symbolic of many powerful things, like victory and balance, and appears throughout history. Its context and meaning is open to interpretation; for this artist, making sculpture is striving for a sense of victory personally and collectively.",

Humanity (represented by the trunk) unites the earth (represented by the roots) to the spirit world (represented by the branches reaching towards the heavens). The Tree of Life speaks of our need to honor spirit as we play here on earth, and through this we find balance. This installation is my response to the apocalyptic energy that has penetrated our entire culture; my belief is that the current paradigm must shift, quickly and dramatically, in order for the planet to survive. The Burning Tree communicates that this shift must occur on an individual basis. It expresses the role of each human as the unifying force between heaven and earth. Only through this magnitude of transformation can the future exist.",

            "description": "Four gigantic metal hands emerge from the playa and create a 30' diameter space, in which participants dance and weave a brc.of white yarn, using the hands to connect the yarn. Participants can write their hopes and fears for the future on paper tags which will be tied into the ever denser brc. The action of brc.ing will be initiated by the dancers each sundown, and participants will join in weaving the inner space. A minimal ambient hypnotic sound-design will accompany their thoughts as they weave their own paths through the space between the hands and inspire people to gradually start to dance in relation to the mesh. The more people weave, the denser the brc.will become. Thus each participant has to face the actions and paths of previous players. The white yarn will be illuminated with black light, bringing the brc.to a glow. The yarn represents our path through life, our patterns, memory, and neurological network, as well as the consequences and interconnectedness of our own and other people&rsquo;s actions.",

The construction method is according to the principals of the Russian engineer Suchow: to create the layers as thin as possible and to avoid huge beams in the structure. The surfaces of the two bodies have a virtually homogenous fa\u00e7ade, which appears as one simple body. People and wind will keep the outer Cone in rotation while several dynamos on the inside are generating electricity. Depending on how much energy can be produced the dynamos will power a light beam and several other light effects. Thus people can immediately enjoy the self-produced energy inside and outside the construction.",

In their era, the great Gothic cathedrals were ultimate symbols of hope and fear in the future &#151; the hope of a New Jerusalem that awaited the faithful, and the fear of eternal punishment and Armageddon. In the history of our western culture, the cathedral remains as a timeless embodiment of place for spiritual gathering and primary religious experiences. Our vision of Cathedral, as well as for faith and worship in the future, retains the qualities of communion with the divine, but we envision it also as a place for any to worship as they please, side by side in harmony, mutual respect and tolerance, without dogmatic conflict or even need for dogma. Our Cathedral is the physical expression of this hope, and an opportunity for a living practice of these beliefs. The Cathedral aspires to inspire all BRC residents to participate and interact with it; to generate ritual, ceremony, and art; to dance, celebrate, and surrender; to experience joy, communion, and spirit; to play together in laughter, fun, and silliness.",

The electric car, once the \"zero-emissions\" darling of environmentalists, is sometimes maligned as an \"emissions-elsewhere\" vehicle, since the electricity to charge its batteries must be generated in electrical generation plants that produce emissions. This is a reasonable point, but we must then ask how much pollution an electric car produces per mile - accounting for all emissions, starting from the gas or oil well where the source fuel is extracted, all the way to the final consumption of electricity by the car's motor. When we work through the numbers, we find that the electric car is significantly more efficient and pollutes less than all alternatives",

The counterpoint to this past aesthetic is the television at the base of each structure which serves as a symbol of a range of time in modernity. Above each television hangs a large, heavy, dangerous, industrial object. The precarious positions of the objects above the televisions serve as a metaphor for modern humanity&rsquo;s propensity for being its own worst enemy. The video images on each of the televisions are of the four Aristotelean elements; earth, air, water and fire and were shot on the Black Rock Desert during different seasons of the year.",

While there, travelers contemplated the end of the known world and then burned their pilgrimage clothes in order to begin a new journey homeward. The installation site and performance (which will occur near sundown on Thursday and Friday) offer burners an opportunity to reflect on ideas of death, rebirth, the end of time, the end of the known and the beginning of the unknown, and if they choose, transmute paper messages with hopes, fears, and dreams into fire by placing them in an altar-like burn barrel.",

The Giving Tree offers two unique and reciprocal opportunities: to imprint a willing recipient--the Tree itself--with your language, and to absorb and respond to the language of those who have come before you. The Giving Tree allows participants to change the language that nature speaks--and, in turn, rethink the kinds of dialogues we thereby make possible and in which we participate. The Tree's calm receptivity to fluxes in its environment encourages introspective awareness of our role in the personal and natural community of which we form parts.",

Anonymous notes would go to a sealed trunk with a mail slot located at center camp for people to look through the clear lid on the trunk, and see the lost fears and hopes but not touch them.",

            "description": "The Starry Bamboo Mandala is a new interpretation of an ancient legacy of sacred spaces. Mandala, which means \"container of essence\" in Sanskrit, has long symbolized both a microcosm of the universe from the human perspective as well as spiritual centers of meditation. In contrast to the 2-dimensional mandalas of Hindu and Buddhist religions, however, this mandala has been translated into 3-dimensions. Seen from above, the eight columns are arranged in a circular pattern on the ground, symbolizing an 8-spoked \"wheel of life\" as it is known in Buddhism. Midway up the structure, the horizontally extending bamboo arms transform this wheel into an (8\/3) star polygon... a geometric pattern found frequently in Islamic art. Further up, a shift in the arrangement of horizontal bamboo poles creates an (8\/2) star polygon,\nalso known as the Star of Lakshmi. The structure terminates at an invisible point 55 feet up from ground level, at the vertex of a star point as seen from ground level. The structure\u00b4s principal dimensions of 55' high x 55' wide essentially enclose it in a giant invisible cube... and the star polyhedra\u00b4s center at the 27.5 foot midpoint define a giant sphere within that cube. Furthermore, a Fibonacci sequence of numbers, found in nature\u00b4s countless geometric patterns, is also found within the structure. The building material, bamboo, is strong, light, and incredibly flexible; multifunctional and highly renewable to the point of being indispensable in cultures ranging from Latin America to Asia; and it exudes a curious mixture of humble abandon and dignified poise.",
