Come out to Witch Well AZ and join us for 4 days of large scale art, music, performance, and interactive participation. The Azburners are an interactive group of artists, performers, musicians and participants of the Burning Man event that takes place in the Black Rock Desert, Nevada. Toast! is not a rave, it is an event created by the Azburners community to bring the culture of Burning Man and Black Rock City to our region. We expect each attendee to participate in the event in some way. Participation and creative interaction is a core value of our culture. Create, participate, no spectators! Respect for alternative lifestyles and cultures is required. There is no water or power on this property. We will have porta-potties available for your use. You must bring everything you need to survive for four days in a hostile desert environment, then pack it all out with you when it is over. There is no garbage disposal, you must haul it out and dispose of it properly. Create, participate, pack it in-pack it out, leave no trace! This is a 21 years of age and over event. No one under 21 will be admitted without parents, legal guardian or spouse who is at least 21.\r\n", "creator": 17, "deleted": false, "created": "2009-02-17 17:45:47", "members": [17], "slug": "toast", "tags": "toast, regional", "name": "Toast!"}}]
